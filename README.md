# Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-Analysis

This project was a part of the course Knowledge discovery in database (ITCS 6155)

The following are full filled as per the requiremnents:


* After completing the model building, you should then focus on model evaluation and explaining your overall project.

* You should perform model evaluation and compare your different models. You should calculate overall accuracy of your models, as well as their precision and recall (if appropriate). If appropriate, you should use confusion matrices and other forms of evaluation. You should conclude with selecting a "best" model. If there are tradeoffs or problems, you should state them.

This project has two components:

* Submit your completed Jupyter Notebook. It should be annotated explaining your model choices, evaluation methods, and other important decisions.

* An 8 to 10 minute video discussing your project as a whole. You should focus on the model selection and evaluation stage. Answer the following questions:

 * What dataset did you choose, and how did that impact your model selection?
 * Which models did you select?
 * What is the best and worst model?
 * Why do you think the best model performed best?
 * What would you do in the next iteration of this project?
 * What have you learned from this project?
